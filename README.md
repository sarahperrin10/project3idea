# Art Project 3 Idea

### Mass Shootings in the U.S.

For my next project, I want to expand upon the idea in this preliminary sketch. I am thinking of incorporating a map of the U.S. and when the user hovers over a certain state they are told the gun laws and gun deaths in that state. The CDC's fatal injury report is a good data source to find this information.

I also want to continue to use the red, white, and blue colors as I do in this sketch to further the idea that mass shootings are primarily a US issue. In addition, I hope this sketch shows the deadly consequences of the "patriotic" arguement that automatic weapons and other deadly assult rifles are protected under the US Constitution.
